### 🎟️ Voucher Generator Automation Tool (Python)

A high-speed automation solution that generates thousands of print-ready vouchers — each with unique IDs and scannable QR codes — inside a single PDF file. Instead of manually editing voucher images one by one, this tool overlays identifiers and QR codes onto a template and scales output to exact physical dimensions, making it production-ready for mass printing.

**Highlights**
- Generates 1,000–5,000+ vouchers in minutes
- Dynamic QR + text placement using pixel-accurate coordinates
- Test mode for layout verification before full batch
- Produces a single multi-page PDF optimized for printing
- Fully customizable numbering formats and QR naming patterns

**Tech Stack:** Python, ReportLab, Pillow, Pandas, OpenPyXL
